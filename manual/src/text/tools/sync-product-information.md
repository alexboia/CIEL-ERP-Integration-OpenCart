# Sync product information in bulk

In order to sync product information for all connected products, navigate to `NextUp ERP - Sync products`.
You have the following options:
- sync all the product information (both stock quantities and prices) - choose `All information` from the available dropdown;
- sync product stock quantities only - choose `Stocks only` from the available dropdown.

Click the `Updated product information` button and wait for the operation to finish.
When the operation is completed, a report will be displayed with:

- `Eligible products` - then number of products that have been connected to NextUp ERP;
- `Updated products` - the number of products that have actually be updated.
