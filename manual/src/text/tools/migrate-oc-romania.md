# Migrate from OpenCart Romania connector format

If you previously used OpenCart Romania's Ciel Connector extension and wish to migrate the existing product connections maintained by it,
you can use this tool.

To begin with, navigate to `NextUp ERP - Migrate from OC Romania`.
After that, click the `Migrated product information` button and wait for the operation to complete.

</div>

Please note that this features is offered on a best-effort basis: if the target extension has changed the way it stores product connections, then the operation may fail.
