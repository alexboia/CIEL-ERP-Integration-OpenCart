# Limitations

1. There is no automatic stock update feature;
2. Migrating connected products from OpenCart Romania's extension is done on a best-effort basis: if the expected structure differs from the actual one, results may differ;
3. Due to the way OpenCart stores order and order item costs and prices, this extension needs to deduce some costs and prices that NextUp ERP expects, the result being that there may be differences between the OpenCart order costs and prices and NextUp ERP document costs and prices;
4. Since OpenCart product options don't have reference/SKU codes, they cannot be mapped to NextUp ERP articles/products.
